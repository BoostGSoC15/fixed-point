
There is support for most <cmath> functions for the fixed-point
negatable class. These include elementary transcendental functions,
exponential functions, power functions, logarithmic functions,
and various other mathematical support functions.

Elementary transcendental functions have been implemented in
three precision ranges:
1) for (-resolution <= 11),
2) for (-resolution >  11) && (-resolution <= 24),
3) for (-resolution >  24).

The first precision range with (-resolution <= 11) is intended
for optimized calculations with tiny 16-bit fixed-point
negatable numbers. The elementary transcendental functions in this
precision range have been specifically optimized for the type
negatable<4, -11>. The elementary transcendental functions
in this precision range will also work properly with other
fixed-point splits as long as (-resolution) remains 11 or less.

The second precision range with (-resolution > 11) && (-resolution <= 24)
is intended for optimized calculations with 32-bit negatable numbers.
The elementary transcendental functions in this precision range
have been optimized for the type negatable<7, -24>. This type has
approximately the same number of fractional digits as single-precision
floating-point in IEEE-754. The elementary transcendental functions
in this precision range will also work properly with other
fixed-point splits as long as (-resolution) remains 24 or less.

The third range is for larger negatable numbers and extends
the range of the functions to negatable types built from
both wide built-in types as well as multiple-precision back-ends.
This extends the fixed-point negatable <cmath> functions well beyond
the range of built-in types to a precision limited only by the
underlying range of the multiple-precision back-end itself.

Implementation notes:
Elementary transcendental functions use polynomial approximations
in the smaller two precision ranges. In the larger precision range,
various calculational methods are used, in particular Taylor series
expansion and Newton-Raphson iteration.
