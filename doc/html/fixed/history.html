      Vicente Botet Escriba produced a prototype at <a href="http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/sandbox/fixed_point" target="_top">http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/sandbox/fixed_point</a>
      asked a number of questions, and replies from the current author Christopher
      Kormanyos (that provided the basis for the implementation here) were:
    </p>
<p>
      First up, one might want to consider some top-level requirements.
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
          How might fixed-point fit with an extended complex class? - If Boost.Multiprecision
          or a multiprecision type is ever specified, how might fixed-point fit with
          it. - If a multiprecision integer type ever gets specified, should the
          representation of fixed-point be allowed to use it for mantissa and decimal
          parts?
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Should integers and reals be represented by separated classes? I don't
          see the need for integers in the first place. I'm wondering if the library
          will be simpler as the operations are not the same. If we have only one
          class, enable_if should be used to make the difference.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Should signed and unsigned be represented by separated classes? Yes, in
          my opinion. I guess, perhaps, the separate sign information might be a
          necessity. But I'm not sure. I think that when a single word is enough
          to represent the fixed-point 2's complement is the bets choice. When more
          than a word is needed, having the sing on all the word is a lost of space,
          and as you say whether it is represented represented by left-most word/limb
          or as a separated data should be an internal decision. In this case using
          more space seems IMO to be a minor issue.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Should the library use a specific representation for signed numbers (separated
          sign, 2-complement? Let the user choose?) Very good question. A separate
          bool flag for sign slows down the library and increases storage requirements.
          The sign of the left-most limb could be the sign. But this breaks down
          for all-fractional types. I guess, perhaps, the separate sign information
          might be a necessity. But I'm not sure.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Should the library provide arbitrary range and resolution and allocators?
          Unfortunately, the allocator seems necessary for high digit counts. But
          perhaps a hybrid container with compile-time width for low limb-count and
          allocation for a (specifiable, zero allowed) higher limb count could be
          used here. But be sure to make fixed-point fast for low digit counts, possibly
          using template specialization when the fixed-point can be represented by
          a built-in integer type (in assiciation with "get my int type"
          compile-time helper templates). This is what I have done in the past. Low
          digit counts is the key range for fixed.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Should the library be open to overflow and rounding or just implement some
          of the possible policies? and in this case which ones? Where do you start,
          where do you stop? This is like the sign bit. Do you want extra information
          for the sub-normals or use some magic values?
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Should fixed_point be convertible to/from integer/float/double? Yes, absolutely,
          in my opinion. Implicit or explicit conversion?
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Could the result of an arithmetic operation have more range and resolution
          than his arguments? No. But copy construction and copy assign maybe, whereby
          the LHS dictates the digit count.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Is there a need for a specific fixed_point I/O?

<li class="listitem">
          Is there a need for a specific I/O? Yes.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          is there a need for radix other than 2 (binary)? Coming from a guy who
          has written <span class="bold"><strong>a lot</strong></span> of specialized number
          classes... I have always been haunted by radix-10. Never again for me.
          Radix-2 and don't look back (my opinion). I prefer also to concentrate
          on Radix-2 and leave Radix-10 for another library.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Should the library implement the basic functions, or should it imperatively
          implement the C++11 math functions? Could a first version just forward
          to the c++11 math functions? It should fit in with Boost.Multiprecision,
          if there ever is such a thing. Users like me who need a tiny set of trig
          functions for, say, an 8-bit controller can roll-their-own via template
          specialization. Don't even get started with Cordic, Chebyshev, polynomial
          expansion, Don't even get started with cordic, Chebyshev, polynomial expansion,
          Pade, Taylor, Newton-Raphson, FFT multiplication, AGM, etc., etc., etc.
          and the rest. Just make the numbers! We will be happy for that because
          it's really a lot. C++ should have the templated math functions and an
          extended complex type elsewhere. You just need to make the number types.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Should the library support just one of the know ways to name a fixed-point,
          a U(a,b), nQm, ...? Provide some ways to move from one to another?
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          Could expect the same/better performances respect to hand written code?
          It's implementation-dependent. But if your 7.8 and 15.16 signed splits
          are slower than single-precision float on an 8-bit core, you will get flack
          for it.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          What should be the size used by a fixed_point instance? _fast? _least?
          Should the user be able to decide which approach is better for his needs?
          It's implementation defined. For small digit counts, I would try to fit
          it in a built-in type. For medium digit counts, a fixed, optionally fixed-hybrid
          container of <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">std</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">uint_fast32_t</span></code>. For very high counts,
          use an established fast integer representation with its own fast-multiply
          (like a potential Boost.Multiprecision).

      Phil Endecott observed on overflow:
    </p>
<p>
      "Some people conflate fixed point with features like saturation, which
      I would prefer to decouple. Fixed-point arithmetic without saturation is useful,
      as is integer arithmetic with saturation. So I'd prefer to make them orthogonal,
      but compatible, concepts. "

      names should be used for the template parameters?</a>
    </h5>
<p>
      Crowl's paper uses <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Crng</span></code> and
      <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Crsl</span></code> (<code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Crnd</span></code>
      and <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Covf</span></code>) but some believe
      that <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Range</span></code> and <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Resolution</span></code> (<code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Round</span></code>
      and <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Overflow</span></code>) are much more
      reader-friendly and have been adopted.

      the resolution parameter be required to be negative?</a>
    </h5>
<p>
      Crowl's paper also uses negative values for <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">Resolution</span></code>.
    </p>
<p>
      At present the sign of the resolution is required to be negative. Many do not
      find this intuitive, or helpful. The rationale for this seems unconvincing.
      Should it be positive?
    </p>
<h5>
<a name="fixed.history.h2"></a>
      <span class="phrase"><a name="fixed.history.nonnegative_and_the_sign_bit"></a></span><a class="link" href="history.html#fixed.history.nonnegative_and_the_sign_bit">nonnegative
      and the sign bit</a>
    </h5>
<p>
      Is it right that we don't get any more resolution for the unsigned version
      <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">nonnegative</span></code> even though we
      are not using a bit for sign?
    </p>
<p>
      This is a tough design choice. It's a bit tricky for the following reason.
      The <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">negatable</span></code> class performs
      all operations internally with <code class="computeroutput"><span class="keyword">unsigned</span></code>
      representations, keeping track of the sign of the result independently. This
      allows us to utilize the sign bit for one additional left shift slot, thereby
      providing one extra digit for rounding.
    </p>
<p>
      The <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">nonnegative</span></code> class can and
      does use the full width of its underlying unsigned data representation. Internal
      operations, however, still require one extra bit for rounding. For this reason,
      the key nonnegative examples use types such as <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">nonnegative</span><span class="special">&lt;</span><span class="number">15</span><span class="special">,</span>
      <span class="special">-</span><span class="number">16</span><span class="special">&gt;</span></code>.
      The type <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">nonnegative</span><span class="special">&lt;</span><span class="number">16</span><span class="special">,</span> <span class="number">16</span><span class="special">&gt;</span></code> will fill the underlying 32-bit data field
      entirely, but will require 65 bits for multiply, divide, etc. So as it turns
      out using 31 bits provides for better optimization.
    </p>
<p>
      This could of course be solved better if a there was a more clever <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">mul</span></code> and <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">div</span></code>
      instead of the current lazy way. This might be improved later.
